# Linked Art (MCP) Proxy

## Description

Use data transformation routines extracted from LUX (https://github.com/project-lux/data-pipeline) to retrieve records from a variety of data sources, then transform those records into Linked Art, to then provide access in code, over HTTP, or via MCP for LLM consumption. It adds a `searcher` class that allows (simple) searching of the data sources.

It was developed during a workshop organized to explore the potential of linked data and large language models for cultural heritage.
